Online Blood Bank

## Getting Started

With the rise of population, the demand of every resource increasing drastically and this becomes critical problem when the resource is related to someone's life.
Every day thousands of people die in hospitals because of not getting sufficient blood when they require it most and sometimes due to their financial conditions they are not able to buy blood bottles. There are so many kind-hearted people who want to donate blood for free of cost to save someone's life but in this case, many hurdles come in between the needy and the selfless person who is trying to help.

## What it does
Here is our app Daan, It is a portal between a person who wants to help and one who needs help in case of blood donation. The Simple UI and amazing UX of Daan are easy to use app for every section of society. One who is in need of blood will have to just download the Daan app on his mobile phone, register himself using authentic credentials and that's it. Now he will see a list of all people with their name, age, phone number, blood group, and other details who are willing to donate their blood. We all have faced the Corona pandemic which shook the world, many people couldn't get blood on time because of the limited resources in the hospitals and their high rates. Also, no one was allowed to go to crowded hospitals and donate blood. That time we were not prepared but now we are prepared and if there comes another pandemic then we will fight together.

## How I built it
We First Created the UI of the App in Figma And after that, we Worked on the frontend part of the App and for the backend, we are using Firebase.


## What's next for Daan
Currently, this is the first version of our app we are going to add more features like google maps API which will help in locating the person, we are also going to add a chatting feature and we are going to add Firebase also..

Built With
